# Web Spice

Web Spice runs electric simulation in your web browser.

I want to recreate [EEcircuit/EEsim](https://github.com/eelab-dev/EEcircuit) using vue3. And, given the original project only takes spice code as input, I want to add schematic editor to improve the circuit readability.

## Plan
- [*] port ngspice
- [ ] re-implement plotter (working on it)
- [ ] port spice code editor
- [ ] parse the spice code using tree-sitter
- [ ] add schematic rendering
- [ ] add interactive schematic editing
